## Objectives 

In this instructional article, I will thoroughly explain how to prep cornish hen houses for Tyson Foods. 
After much deliberation, I have decided to write an instructional document on how to raise cornish hen chickens for Tyson Foods. I have experience raising chickens for Tysons, and I believe that with my personal experience in the industry, I can create an instructional document for people who are just starting out in the poultry industry. My audience that I will try to captivate will be people who are just starting out in the business or people who might want to have a career in this field.

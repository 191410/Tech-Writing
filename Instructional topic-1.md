## Introduction to raising cornish hens

Cornish hens are chickens that are 24-26 days old and are primarily raised for human consumption. These chickens are usually sold whole in the food store for the consumers to purchase and weigh roughly 1.50-2.00 lbs. On average, eight billion chickens are consumed each year worldwide which demonstrates the high demand for chicken. Understanding how to prepare the houses for baby chickens plays an important role in the overall growing process. The steps will be in chronological order starting with the first task after the cornish hens are sold to Tyson Foods and ending with the final task before recieving baby cornish hens from Tysons. In order to perform the tasks at hand, there is a variety of tools and equipment needed.

The equipment needed consists of:
- Tractor with front end loader, rear blade attachment, and priefert litter saver attachment

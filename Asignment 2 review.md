1. Throughout this assignment, I was able to learn more about blog writing and how to write them in a manner that is attractive for the user and also informative. I also developed skills in creating and designing a website with wordpress. This was my first time using wordpress and overall, I was thoroughly impressed with the features and the steps that they guide you with as you design your website.

2. Something that I still have questions about is just different features in wordpress that I couldn't get to work. This is primarily because I am new to this program and the lack of experience that I have using it. With more time, I eventually would have figured it out. One of which was how to scale down featured images in the blog posts. My images were too big and I could not figure out how to scale them down to a more apealing size.

## What are my writing habits?
- When writing a paper of any substantial length, I often will perform my research and then sit down and knock out the writing portion. Generally, I will write the paper in one day so that I am completely finished with the peice of writing that I am working with. Occasionally I will break it up into sections if the required assigntment calls for numerous pages and extensive research. I do this so that I will be done with the asignment and not have to worry about it anymore. This is a problem because I often find myself brain dead half-way through and my work becomes sloppy rather than well thought out.
## How might those habits improve?
- I need to not procrastinate and pace myself through a larger paper. This will allow me to focus better and to write better material that is well thought out and not messy. I also need to take my time writing out my material rather than rushing through it to complete the asignment.
## What is one strength?
-Generally I do a good job of proof reading and fixing the majority of my mistakes. In addition, another strength that I think I have is my ability to focus and put my thoughts into words fairly quickly.

## Assignment 1 Review

After completing the instructional document for assignment 1, I felt pretty good about the finished product considering this was my first project using github and markdown. I did my instructional document on how to prepare houses for cornish hens from Tysons. I grew up on a poultry farm and was able to use my knowledge from experience to help me complete the assignment. Even though I understood how to complete each task, it was a challenge to create an instructional document that thoroughly explained the topic so that my audience would fully grasp the subject. Overall, I felt as though I was able to present my points in a manner that explained the information clearly. However, I know for certain that their were probably some parts that were unclear or wasn't explained enough. 

 It was also challenging to explain the task thoroughly in 1000 words. In order to explain the task in full, I could have explained different aspects of it differently and in more detail. Overall, I still felt good about the assignment and I now have a broader understanding on how to use markdown and github. I am still learning how to use certain aspects of it; however, I felt I learned valuable skills that have helped me become a better technical writer.
